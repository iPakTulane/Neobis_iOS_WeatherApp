## Description
This iOS weather application offers a seamless experience for users to search for a city and retrieve up-to-date weather information from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/). The project emphasizes the implementation of key features such as city search functionality, integration with the open weather API, and a well-thought-out user interface. The user interface is constructed using the SnapKit library for efficient screen layout.

## Architectural Pattern
The app implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase in the future. The architecture is designed to accommodate the specific requirements of a weather application, emphasizing efficiency in data retrieval and presentation.

## Frameworks
The project relies on the following technologies and libraries:
- Cocoapods for dependency management
- Snapkit for efficient and flexible UI layout
- JSON for handling data interchange
- URL Session for network communication
- HTTP Requests to interact with the open weather API

## How to Use
To use the Neobis_iOS_WeatherApp, follow these steps:
1. Open the application on your iOS device.
2. Use the city search functionality to find the desired location.
3. View the real-time weather information retrieved from the openweathermap.org API.

## How to Install
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pod install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Open the project workspace in Xcode.
5. Build and run the application on your iOS device or simulator.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into working with APIs, handling JSON data, and implementing efficient UI layouts using SnapKit.
